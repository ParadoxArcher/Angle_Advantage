# SpeedAccel Problem
[[Boost]] #SpeedDecel sets #SpeedAccel to 0 when [[Brake]] is applied as it becomes greater than #SpeedAccel, the clamp on velocity lerp prevents #AccelRate from becoming 0. Need to rewrite #AccelRate equation to not brick when overdosed

- #SpeedDecel has been clamped to a maximum of #SpeedAccel before applying #CounterAccel, preventing #AccelRate from becoming negative.
	- #CounterAccel has been scaled by #velocity in relation to #MaxSpeed to scale #SpeedDecel accordingly
- a push_warning has been set for when #AccelRate is clamped by #SpeedDecel exceeding #SpeedAccel 



- Consider utilizing #SpeedAccel - #SpeedDecel sign in order to flip boost direction and take absolute value of AccelRate

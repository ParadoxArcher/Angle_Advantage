## SpeedAccel Problem
[[Boost]] #SpeedDecel sets #SpeedAccel to 0 when [[Brake]] is applied as it becomes greater than #SpeedAccel, the clamp on velocity lerp prevents #AccelRate from becoming 0. Need to rewrite #AccelRate equation to not brick when overdosed

### Solution
- #SpeedAccel and #SpeedDecel no longer use one velocity 

## Optimized [[Brakes]]
instead of declaring #isBreaking inside an if statement and declaring if statements for both #SpeedDecel and #RotaDecel, it now uses the original if statement to declare them
